\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Context: learning during programming courses
	
	\item Problem: \textit{early} identification of potential dropout students
	
	\item Solution: exercises system, metrics measurement, and clustering algorithms.
	
	\item Evaluation: metrics collection during 3,5 years of real programming courses at UFAL, Brazil. Main results: in the first 30 days of the courses we analyzed, our approach could identify students that did not complete the course successfully. We believe that providing early support to these students right after this identification in 30 days, they will have better chance of completing the course.
	
	\item Contributions: approach/strategy?
