\section{Early detection of potential dropout students}

\label{sec:strategy}

This way, the problem we address in this paper consists of a strategy to \textit{early} identify potential drop out students. Notice that identifying early is very important in the sense that professors still have enough time to act and avoid students to fail the course. This way, we focus exclusively on early identifying these students. Providing or reporting a technique useful to reduce the dropout rate is outside the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, notice that when identifying them we may study the data and afterwards provide a technique to do so. Actually, based on the results of this paper, we intend to propose a technique to reduce the drop out rate as future work.

Next, we detail our strategy to identify these students.

\subsection{Online exercises system}

To evaluate the students performance during the course, we use an online exercises system named Huxley~\cite{}. \todo{algum texto ja pronto?}

Problem-solving approach

The more practice the more learning

Programming is learned by programming, not from books~\cite{}.
The Huxley allows student to avoid the ``learned helplessness'' problems. This problem happens when a student who has missed a basic concept and who then cannot follow the next lecture. She believes that there is no going back; the course is behaving very much as a high-speed train with no brakes. Such a student will quickly come to the view that ``they just can't do programming'', and will attribute this to the perceived difficulty of the subject.

\subsection{Metrics}

\label{sec:metrics}

We use two metrics in our strategy. We explain them in what follows:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Number of submissions:} this metric represents the number of submissions a student do during the course. As explained, Huxley provides more than 300 programming exercises. To solve a particular problem, a student needs to submit at least one solution.

	\item \textbf{Number of correct submissions:} if a student solves one problem, we increase this metric by one.

\end{itemize}

Depending on the level of difficulty of a problem, students may submit several times to solve it. However, notice that this is not necessarily a bad thing regarding the learning process. For example, submitting many times means that students are somehow practicing and studying continuously. Thus, although she is not hitting a right solution, she is trying hard and will eventually hit one. Nevertheless, we need to carefully analyze \todots

\subsection{Clustering algorithm}

To identify potential dropout students, we use the well-known clustering algorithm k-means~\cite{}. As input, we set the algorithm to compute three groups. To compute the groups, the algorithm takes into account the metrics we present in Section~\ref{sec:metrics}.

We choose three groups because ???

\subsection{Summary}

Figure~\ref{fig:strategy} combines all steps of our strategy. As the classes are happening, students are encouraged to solve exercises using the problems of Huxley. Although solving exercises is not mandatory, there some particular activities where the professor forced students to use Huxley. Next, we collect the metrics we detailed in Section~\ref{sec:metrics}. Then, we execute a R script we implemented to execute the clustering algorithm. As can be seen, there are three groups, represented by circles, squares, and stars. \todo{falar dos 30 dias}

Now, according to the groups, we have the potential dropout students, the ones that have a small number of submissions and correct submissions (represented by circles). Notice we also have students that are potential candidates to successfully pass (represented by stars): after 30 days, they seem to be studying hard, due to the high number of submissions.

After applying the clustering algorithm, we need to check if the algorithm correctly predicted the dropout students. To do so, we use the academic system of the Federal University of Alagoas to look for grades and check whether the students passed or not. For example, for the detached star, the algorithm pointed it right: after 30 days, it identified the student would pass and she did. The same happened for the detached circles: after 30 days, the algorithm pointed that both students would not pass and they did not. Nevertheless, notice that our strategy is susceptible to false positives (the algorithm pointed the student would pass, but she did not) and false negatives (the algorithm pointed the student would not pass, but she did). We shall consider and discuss these cases in Section~\ref{}.

After confronting the algorithm results with the academic system, we perform some statistics.
