Reducing the failure rate in programming courses has been achieved in previous work~\cite{}. The authors performed a study during four semesters. They identified three main factors to reduce the failure rate: (i) using Python as the first introductory programming language, which, according to the authors, may lead the students to better focus on algorithms and problem solving, instead of spending time with advanced concepts of other existing languages at an early stage of the learning process; (ii) using visualization environments to support students and improve the way they can understand abstract concepts related to programming; and (iii) assigning individual problems to each student, hindering students sharing or borrowing solutions to their friends. Like our work, the authors are concerned with the high rate of failure students. However, while they focus on a solution to decrease such numbers, we provide a strategy---evaluated in seven semesters---to early (30 days) identify potential failing students. Then, professors and assistants may act to help these students with additional classes and particular conversations. After studying and understanding why exactly they tend to fail, we then are ready to provide a solution. \todo{achei esse final meio estranho. Nao vendi bem!}

MasterMind predictor (game)~\cite{lorenzenC06-mastermind-predictor-sigcse2008}
This paper claims that it is possible to predict weather a student will fail by playing a mastermind game. However, unfortunately the paper presents no data to support this claim. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the literature that the test was successfully applied in a different context.

Practice is very important in programming activities~\cite{on-automated-grading}

a large number of students with mediocre high school grades and standardized examination scores are able to succeed;~\cite{butcher-predictor-high-school-1985} 


PREDICTING PERFORMANCE IN AN INTRODUCTORY COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE. In this paper the high school data and ACT scores were used to predict college performance in computer science courses. However, their goal is to predict students who had successfully completed one year of study in computer science in general and not only computer programming. Besides, they use data that are only available in US, then it is difficult to replicate to other countries.
