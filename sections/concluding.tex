\section{Concluding Remarks}

This paper presented a strategy able to identify \textit{early} potential failing students in introductory programming courses. We focused on the identification, rather than on approaches to avoid the failings, e.g., changing the programming language. Our strategy consists of three simple steps: the use of an online judge system, the collection of metrics from this system; and the application of a clustering algorithm. In an empirical study using 7 courses (representing 3.5 years), the results suggest that our strategy can early detect (within only 30 days) the majority of the failing students, which is a promising result. In particular, our results reveal that our strategy successfully identifies 72\% of the failing students with 95\% standard confidence level.

As future work, we intend to use other metrics and clustering algorithms to better define and analyze our strategy. Additionally, by using the results of our strategy during actual semesters, we intend to make professors and mentors aware of the potential failing students. Then, we are ready to evaluate whether the strategy application can somehow help on reducing the high rate of failing students in introductory programming courses.
